Snapline Feature List - Marvin M Diaz & Cole Robinson

Minimums:
CRUD functions with users being able to log in, upload their photos to a public feed, make changes to their profile, and view other's photos.
photos will have a description, a timestamp, and be sorted chronologically.

Bonuses:
Likes, for many to many. 
Friends system, so user's feed is just limited to their friends.
